## Classes and Intentions
- The ChatBot handles multiple levels of interaction:
    - Level I: intents, tag, patterns, intents, tag, patterns, intents, tag, patterns
    - Level IIA: [Provide specific classes/intentions here.]
    - Level IIB: [Provide specific classes/intentions here.]

## Entities and Associations
- [The entities were not directly stated in the code comments. List the entities your ChatBot recognizes here and discuss their relationship with the intentions.]

## Algorithms and Classification Models
- Technologies used include NLTK for text processing, Keras for deep learning models, and Gradio for user interfaces.
- LSTM networks and Embedding layers are used, suggesting a focus on understanding and generating text based on sequences.
